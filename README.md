For this project we did two analysis on the 2020 311-servers requestfor New York City.  The first one analyze what the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are in our zipcode(10038). The second one analyze whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in general and are in our zipcode(10038).

Data:                          
New York City publishes a number of open datasets for public consumption or use. Amongst them is a dataset consisting of calls to the 311 phone number for non-emergency services. Each call to 311 has a number of datapoints tracked and aggregated. The data set contains nearly 2.6 million data entries with 41 different columns.
